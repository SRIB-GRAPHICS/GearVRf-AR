/**
 * Holds any number of {@linkplain GVREyePointee 'eye pointees,'} which are

 * 
 * Ray casting is computationally expensive. Rather than probing the entire
 * scene graph, GVRF requires you to mark parts of the scene as "pickable" by
 * adding their meshes (or, more cheaply if less precisely, their
 * {@linkplain GVRMesh#getBoundingBox() bounding box}) to a
 * {@link GVREyePointeeHolder};
 * {@linkplain GVRSceneObject#attachEyePointeeHolder(GVREyePointeeHolder)
 * attaching} that holder to a {@linkplain GVRSceneObject scene object}; and
 * setting the holder's {@linkplain #setEnable(boolean) enabled flag.}
 * 
 * <p>
 * When you call one of the {@linkplain GVRPicker#pickScene(GVRScene)
 * pickScene() overloads}, you get an array of {@linkplain GVREyePointeeHolder
 * eye pointee holders}. You can then call {@link #getOwnerObject()} to get the
 * scene object that a holder is attached to.
