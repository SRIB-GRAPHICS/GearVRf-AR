/*
 * This is the most important part of gvrf.
 * Initialization can be told as 2 parts. A General part and the GL part.
 * The general part needs nothing special but the GL part needs a GL context.
 * Since something being done while the GL context creates a surface is time-efficient,
 * the general initialization is done in the constructor and the GL initialization is
 * done in onSurfaceCreated().
 * 
 * After the initialization, gvrf works with 2 types of threads.
 * Input threads, and a GL thread.
 * Input threads are about the sensor, joysticks, and keyboards. They send data to gvrf.
 * gvrf handles those data as a message. It saves the data, doesn't do something
 * immediately. That's because gvrf is built to do everything about the scene in the GL thread.
 * There might be some pros by doing some rendering related stuffs outside the GL thread,
 * but since I thought simplicity of the structure results in efficiency, I didn't do that.
 * 
 * Now it's about the GL thread. It lets the user handle the scene by calling the users GVRScript.onStep().
 * There are also GVRFrameListeners, GVRAnimationEngine, and Runnables but they aren't that special.

 * It implements {@link GVRContext}. It handles Android application callbacks

 * <p>
 * Most importantly, {@link #onDrawFrame()} does the actual rendering, using the
 * current orientation from
 * {@link #onRotationSensor(long, float, float, float, float, float, float, float)
 * onRotationSensor()} to draw the scene graph properly.
