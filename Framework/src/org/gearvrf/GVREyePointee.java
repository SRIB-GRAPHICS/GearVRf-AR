/**
 * Super class of GVRMeshEyePointee.
 * 
 * An GVREyePointee is something that is being pointed at by a picking ray.
 * GVREyePointees are held by {@linkplain GVREyePointeeHolder eye pointee
 * holders}. Eye pointee holders are attached to {@link GVRSceneObject}s so they
 * can be returned by the {@link GVRPicker}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This bizarre little class only contains a constructor and was intended as a
 * sort of interface. The only actual {@link GVREyePointee} is
 * {@link GVRMeshEyePointee}.
