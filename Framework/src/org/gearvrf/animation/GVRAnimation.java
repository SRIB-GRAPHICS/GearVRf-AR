/**
 * The root of the GVRF animation tree.
 * 
 * This class (and the {@linkplain GVRAnimationEngine engine}) supply the common
 * functionality: descendants are tiny classes that contain compiled (ie, no
 * runtime reflection is used) code to change individual properties. Most
 * animations involve a {@linkplain GVRTransform scene object's position,}
 * {@linkplain GVRMaterial a scene object's surface appearance,} or an optional
 * {@linkplain GVRPostEffect "post effect":} accordingly, most actual animations
 * descend from {@link GVRTransformAnimation}, {@link GVRMaterialAnimation}, or
 * {@link GVRPostEffectAnimation} and not directly from {@link GVRAnimation}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All animations have at least three or more required parameters: the object to
 * animate, the duration, and any animation parameters. In many cases, there are
 * overloaded methods to specify the animation parameters in convenient ways:
 * for example, you can specify a color as an Android {@link Color} or as a
 * {@code float[3]} of GL-compatible 0 to 1 values. In addition, all the stock
 * animations that animate a type like, say, {@link GVRMaterial} 'know how' to
 * find the {@link GVRMaterial} inside a {@link GVRSceneObject}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This means that most animations have two or four overloaded constructors.
 * This is trouble for the animation developer - who must keep four sets of
 * JavaDoc in sync - but probably clear enough for the animation user. However,
 * there are also four optional parameters: the interpolator, the repeat type,
 * the repeat count, and an on-finished callback. Adding these to an overload
 * tree would, well, overload both developers and users!
 * 
 * <p>
 * Thus, animations use a sort of Builder Pattern: you set the optional
 * parameters <i>via</i> set() methods that return {@code this}, so you can
 * chain them like
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 
 * new GVRScaleAnimation(sceneObject, 1.5f, 2f) //
 *         .setRepeatMode(GVRRepetitionType.PINGPONG) //
 *         .start({@linkplain GVRAnimationEngine animationEngine});
 * </pre>
 * 
 * which will 'pulse' the size of the {@code sceneObject} from its current level
 * to double size, and back.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Animations run in a {@link GVRDrawFrameListener}, so they happen before your
 * {@link GVRScript#onStep() onStep()} handler, which happens before GVRF
 * renders the scene graph. This has two consequences:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When you start an animation in an {@link GVRScript#onStep()} handler, it
 * starts running on the <em>next</em> frame.
 * <li>If you start multiple animations (with the same duration and the same
 * interpolator!) in the same {@code onStep()} handler, they will always be in
 * sync. That is, you can 'compose' animations simply by starting them together;
 * you do not need to write a composite animation that animates multiple
 * properties in a single method.
 * </ul>
